# Bandcamp YAML

A tool to be used with the [hsmusic.wiki](https://github.com/hsmusic) project. Currently doesn't have API access so it's scraping the raw HTML pages at the moment.

## How to
Paste the full URL into the input field, and then hit "Fetch". Depending on how big the album is, you may have to wait for the app to fetch all relevant track info. It will appear in a grey box which you can then copy to your clipboard with the "Copy to clipboard" button.
